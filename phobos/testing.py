# This is module is a test module to test and understand the data structure of Blender's transforms and to check whether the original
# export code is valid or redundant. One of the points to check is whether or not the "apply transform" option does make a whole lot of sense
# and how it influences the geometry of the bounding boxes.

# Test Scenario 1:
# ----------------
# There are three objects:
# - 1: the overall parent, rotated first by 20 degrees, then child 2 was added, then rotation was increased to 40
# - 2: the first degree child, added as child to 1 when it was rotated 20, rotated 20 itself
# - 3: added to 2 AFTER rotation of 2, thus a different case than 1-2
#
# Both 2 and 3 were moved by -3 (-6 in total for 3) in y-direction before any other transforms were applied.
# For none of the objects, rotations were applied.
#
#
# Test Scenario 2:
# The same as above, only that all rotations were applied to the objects.
#
# results can be found in work/mars/blendertools/test
