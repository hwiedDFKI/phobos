Welcome to Phobos's documentation!
==================================

Phobos is an add-on for the open-source 3D modeling software Blender that enables the creation and modification of WYSIWYG robot models for use in robot frameworks like ROS and ROCK or in real-time simulations such as MARS or Gazebo. Phobos allows to export completed models in formats such as URDF or SMURF and meshes as STereoLithography (.stl), Wavefront (.obj) or Collada (.dae).

Phobos was initiated and is currently developed at the Robotics Innovation Center of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Bremen, together with the Robotics Group of the University of Bremen.

User documentation can be found in the Phobos Wiki at https://github.com/rock-simulation/phobos/wiki .

Please contact Kai von Szadkowski for any inquiries, or any questions and feedback not suited for the issues page.
